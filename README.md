## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer data from a banking dataset to identify patterns behind customer churn. Using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, the goal is to generate actionable insights that help banks retain customers and reduce churn.

---

## Business Problem

Customer churn leads to revenue loss in banks. Identifying customers likely to leave and understanding the reasons behind churn is crucial for improving retention strategies.

---

## Core Business Question

Which customers are most likely to churn, and what factors influence their decision?

## Objective

- Identify high-risk customers  
- Analyze behavioral and financial patterns  
- Support data-driven retention strategies  

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle – Bank Customer Churn Data  
- **Rows:** 28,382
